/**
 * wikilink-rules.ts
 *
 * Resolution rules for the wikilink audit script (and, eventually, the
 * site's `src/config/wikilinks.ts` for the `remarkLosslessWikilinks`
 * resolver — same shape, single source of truth).
 *
 * Two rule types:
 *
 *   - `PREFIX_RULES`: when a wikilink path starts with `prefix`, build the
 *     URL by stripping the prefix, slugifying the tail (lowercase, spaces
 *     to hyphens, slashes preserved), and substituting into `template`.
 *     First match wins — list more specific prefixes BEFORE less specific.
 *
 *   - `EXACT_RULES`: when a wikilink path matches `path` exactly (case-
 *     insensitive), use `url` verbatim. For one-off mappings that don't
 *     fit a prefix pattern.
 *
 * Path comparison is case-insensitive throughout (per the resolved decision
 * in `[[Wikilink-Resolution-System]]`). Both `prefix` and `path` should be
 * authored in lowercase here.
